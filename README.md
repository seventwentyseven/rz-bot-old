# What is rz bot
RZ bot or with original name thats unwrittable in repo name "Å» bot", is a bot for managing osu servers on gulag's engine. Right now there's not too much in the code because im rewriting it for 727th time. I want it to be usable on every osu server made on gulag.

You can see our trello board here: https://trello.com/b/sZORcdeI/rz-bot

# Requirements
Bot has been tested on both windows and Ubuntu 18.04 so it can run along with gulag.
I'm too lazy to make requirements.txt right now so here are things that you need:
Python Packages:
- cmyui
- tzdata (If running on windows)
- discord
- sendgrid

Also make sure that your terminal supports colors or it will look extremelly bad.
